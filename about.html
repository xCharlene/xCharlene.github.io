<h1> ABOUT </h1> 

<p> Guess, you want to know about me. I'm a human living in Singapore, who willingly puts in the time to explore marine animals and build legos.
  Actually nanoblocks not legos. Legos take up TOOOOO much space. Feel free to admire my collection of pokemon nanoblocks that I am proud of.
  It's a great testimonial on my temper. (Because they're so small and difficult to handle. It infuriates me. * COUGH *) </p>
